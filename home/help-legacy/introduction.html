				CS-Script (pronounced C sharp script) is a CLR (Common Language Runtime) based 
				scripting system which uses ECMA-compliant C# as a programming language. 
				CS-Script currently targets both Windows and Linux implementations of CLR 
				(MS .NET4.0 and Mono).&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>CS-Script also offers limited support for other programming languages.&nbsp;
			</p>

			
<p><br>
				<b>CS-Script combines the power and richness of C# and FCL with the flexibility of a 
					scripting system. </b>CS-Script can by useful for the system and network 
				administrators, developers and testers. For any one who needs an automation for 
				solving variety of programming tasks such as:</p>
			
<ul>
				<li>
					
    <p>analysing and adjusting system configuration</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>extending functionality of a software system with flexible scripting</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>configuring development or testing environment</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>automating software batch build</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>automating testing, and collecting test results</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>......</p>
				</li>
  <li>
					
    <p>virtually any type of automation on the system and application levels</p>
				</li>
			
</ul>
			
<p><br>
CS-Script as a development system does not compete with other C# based 
				development systems (.NET +Visual Studio, Mono + SharpDevelop, ...). It is just 
				a flexible alternative for the tasks which are hard (or effort
consuming) to 
				implement by non-scripting approaches.</p>

				and <i>"CS-Script"</i>.<br>
