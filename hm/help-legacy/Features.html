<p> Because CS-Script is based on the full featured C# it offers
full access to CLR and CTS. It targets the latest version CLR but the
distributables also include legacy binaries for running onany version of CLR
(.NET 1.1/2.0/3.0/3.5).  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> It offers possibility of extending functionality of any CLR
applications with "scripting", by hosting the script engine in the
application.</p>
<p><br>
It also provides integration with OS, common IDEs and debuggers.</p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<h4 class="dtH4">These are some details of the major
features of the CS-Script development system:</h4>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Programming language is <i><b> CLS-compliant</b></i>
C# (currently JScript, VB.NET, &nbsp;C++/CLI and CC#)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Script engine can run C# code targeting both .NET 1.1 and
.NET 2.0 frameworks</li>
  <li>Any CLS-compliant C# code (standard .cs file) can be used
as a script without any modifications</li>
  <li>CS-Script allows development without the purchase of any
additional products (though integration with MS's or third-party IDE is
highly recommended)</li>
  <li>Automatic script caching ensures lightning performance</li>
  <li>Runtime callable wrappers (proxies) for COM, WCF,
WebService and Remoting can be
dynamically generated on fly, without developer involvement. What makes
CS-Script truly dynamic runtime environment while maintaining it's
statically typed&nbsp;nature.</li>
  <li>Sophisticated algorithm for local assemblies resolving
ensures usage of "plain vanilla.cs"</li>
  <li>Any script <b><i> can be compiled into
executable</i></b>. Thus no script engine is required to
run it.</li>
  <li>Any script <b><i> can be compiled into dll</i></b>.
Thus it can be used by other applications without usage of the script
engine.</li>
  <li>Script engine implementation in a form of assembly
(CSScriptLibrary.dll) is provided. Thus it <b><i> can be
hosted by CLR applications</i></b> (see&nbsp;<a href="Extending_applications.html">Script hosting</a>).</li>
  <li>Script engine can load/execute multiple scripts with
'import' directive thus code from one script can be executed from
another (see&nbsp;<a href="Importing_scripts.html">Importing
scripts</a>).</li>
  <li>Script engine can load at run time assemblies referenced
directly in the script code with 'reference' directive (see <a href="Using_.NET_assemblies.html">Using .NET assemblies</a>).</li>
  <li>Script engine is integrated with Operating System by means
of shell extensions for Windows Explorer</li>
  <li>Integration with the common range of CLR IDEs and debuggers
is available. Currently supported IDEs/Debuggers are .NET Studio
2008/2010, SharpDevelop and MS CLR Debugger.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>C# scripts are very easy to debug with any CLR debugger
available on the target system.</li>
  <li>One debugger can be used to debug both script&nbsp;host
and script itself seamlessly.</li>
  <li> Any script can be easily converted in the Visual Studio
2005 project.</li>
  <li>Supported systems: Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000,
XP,&nbsp;Server 2003, Vista&nbsp;<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">only preliminary
testing has been conducted on Vista</span></li>
