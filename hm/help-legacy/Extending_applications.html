<p>Traditionally scripting has two areas of application: executing a
script as a standalone application and executing a script from another
application (<b>Script Hosting</b>). <b> Script Hosting</b> is a flexible way of
extending native capabilities of the host application. This flexibility
comes from dynamic nature of script execution. </p>
<p>Very often scripts that the host application can execute are not the
fixed collection of "scripted operations" but rather a set of pluggable
script files or in-memory code fragments. Such scripts can be easily
manageable even by the end-user. A good example of such application is
MS Excel where VBScript is used to extend functionality of the main
application. </p>
<p>
CS-Script as a scripting framework can provide development
opportunities for <b>Script Hosting</b> as well. Hosting the CS-Script engine
can be anything between a very simple and moderate complexity
implementation, depending on your programming needs. CS-Script hosting
follows the two major implementation patterns which will be explained
in this section. </p>
